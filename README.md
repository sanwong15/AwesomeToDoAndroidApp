This is a simple android app built for Uber Android bootcamp.

On June 9, 2016:
I have finished the initial To-Do app which satisfly the requirments given by Uber.
Current app can perform the followings:
1. Successfully add and remove items
2. Support Editing todo items
3. Persist todo items and retrieve them properly on app restart

Here's the demo of the app.

This is the gif that I used to test out how to put a GIF on README. It is hilarious so I keep it here.
